The library is in the libraries folder:
	www/sites/all/libraries/mapping-client

The following files needs to be fixed:
	app/app-config.json
	js/bundle.js
		I hardcodded the path of the library in the config. It should try to figure the path of the library by using an approche similar to CKEditor: define a "getPath" function (that's all I know about it sorry)
